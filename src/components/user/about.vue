    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p>My name is Jessen Gilbert. I was raised in Japan for the first 6 years of my life. I have lived
      in many different states and attended many different high schools. I was always much more of an
      athletic and artistic individual as I was growing up but it wasn't until my mid 20's that I realized
      I also enjoyed programming and using my brain for once! I aspire to be a full stack developer, college
      professor, or a javascript master! One day I hope to make my app/website ideas a reality.
